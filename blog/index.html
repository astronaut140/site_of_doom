<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ARRO140'S BLOG</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mostly vents.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here's a potential combo in Blox Fruits (ROBLOX game) with Magma, E-Claw, and Skull Guitar (Magma has to be awakened):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">E-Claw Z + Magma X + E-Claw C + Soul Guitar X + E-Claw X + Magma C (You can also finish off with Magma F since it does damage)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not an insta-kill, but it does some hefty damage. Honestly, I'm not even sure if this combo is true yet. Maybe you could test it out?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Kind of crazy that the only thing that's stopping me from offing myself is the speck of hope for my future, and that's fading away as we speak. I'm not being taught how to drive anymore, because <em>someone's</em> too drunk/high to do anything remotely productive, even for work. If I had a nickel for each workday she has drunk herself out of, every single billionaire walking this planet would be a butler in my house. I would solve world hunger. The Earth would be seen as a penny to my wallet. I could give everyone unfathomable amounts of money. All 8 billion people. The constant smell of second-hand smoke gets old, very quick, and it doesn't help that the vaping brainlets at school remind me of a home that I want to move the fuck out of. I'm talking about this home. I want out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">None of my friends are willing to listen to my vents, so this blog will have to do. Although it's like crying out into a void, that's also what it was like when I used to vent to my friends. It's good to know my troubles fall on deaf ears that only care to interpret Grand Piece Online or Sol's RNG. It's crazy that a girl I've known for no more than 2 weeks at school OR players on fucking WEBFISHING of all games care to hear stories about how this household is crumbling and will inevitably collapse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If nothing's changed by Christmas, it's <strong>all over</strong>. There's only so much a person can take. Or unvent, I don't know.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">WE ARE ONE OF THE SAME</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">WE ARE CARICATURES OF ONE ANOTHER</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">LET US SUPPLY EACH OTHER UNTIL IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">THIS CAN BE OUR SECRET.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had steak for dinner, by the way. Shit's delicious. You haven't lived if you haven't had a steak. Yummers. Tuuuuuuuuuum yu um yum yum :Steak: :meat: :drool: :F YU,. YUM. YUM. The fries too . HGoly shit. ddude its fries. So yummings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can tell I liked my dinner.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SEPTEMBER 29, 2024</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Set up a blog site. Probably won't update this often.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At least it'll update faster than I updated my game that I had so many ideas for. Yet I canceled it. Out of anger. I don't really know how to elaborate on the "anger" part without sounding like a LARPer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I do know how to do though is set up expectations for people and never meet them, sometimes going a completely different route and not only destroying the expectations, but their trust. See literally every one of my exes for more information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I also know how to do, easily in fact, is let myself get captured in many, many mood swings that have caused many bridges to burn. It's totally puberty! This TOTALLY didn't start at the age of 7 instead of 13! Trust me guys.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can't decide if someone having mood swings is puberty-related, especially if they've been going through it for over 9 years. When they were a child. That's just not how mental health works, and I know a specific someone would know to both be informed on how mental health works and how basic psychology works. Shanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That last part right there? Why, that's just another product of both of my parent's horrible personalities! I like to shift the blame on other people, sometimes subconsciously. Hey look, I just did it! Can you spot it? I know you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This list can go on for light years! I have many, many flaws about me as a person! If you're reading this, I know for a fact you don't want to fix them. You don't know me, or you do, I don't know. Even if you do want to fix these issues, good luck. Some aspects of my personality never left the "mine!" phase of my early childhood. That's just a hint at the difficulty!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you don't want to read all of what's above, I'll summarize: I'm a bad person, and I hope to dissuade you from socializing with me with this information. Hope it worked!</p>
